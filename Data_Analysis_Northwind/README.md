This is an analysis made in the Northwind database. The steps of the thought process and the conclusions
are explained step by step in the `.ipynb` file.

I migrated the database from SQLite to my PostgreSQL local server. The file named `createDBandTables.py` creates the database in PostgreSQL and implements a function for creating each new table. The file named `dataMigration.py` does the other part.
